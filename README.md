Paper Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935

### Clone the repository

```git
git clone https://github.com/FaisalAhmed0/Deep-Leakage-from-Gradients
```

### you can setup a new environment and install requirements.txt

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
```

### activate the new environment and run train.py
e.g To train saint_i model in self-supervised mode, run;

```bash
python train.py --dataset mnist
```

### TODO

1. Evalute the algorithm on text.
